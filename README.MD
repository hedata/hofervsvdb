# Broadcasting or Discussing? The Use of the Social Media Tool Twitter by Austrian Politicians during the Presidential Election 2016

In the case of Austrian elections, empirical research regarding the use of
social media tools especially Twitter is, to the best of our knowledge, missing.
This leaves the research community with a lack of knowledge. To fill this gap
and foster our understanding of social media tool use of politicians in Austria
during elections, we gathered and systematically analyzed all tweets of the two
candidates for the 2016 presidential election, Alexander Van der Bellen and
Norber Hofer, during their campaign.


Research Questions: To what extent did Hofer and Van der Bellen use
Twitter during their campaign, and how did the usage change over time? Who
is more popular on twitter? What were the main topics used by the candidates -
are they simply broadcasting their messages or are they discussing specific topics
with the public?

Approach: To answer our first research question we present and apply descriptive analyses of the candidates tweets. The second research question is tackled through a wordcloud.

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks which where used during the analysis and the latex code needed to generate the report.
